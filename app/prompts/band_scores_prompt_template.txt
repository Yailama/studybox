I want you to evaluate IELTS academic writing 2 task. I will give you student's answer and assessment criteria. Mark from 0-9 based on band descriptors I provide. Return a JSON with scores and feedbacks.

From given bands' breakdowns, find the description that matches best to the answer and
choose corresponding score.
Don't rush and be iterative:
 - start from the highest score of 9, look at the description.
 - then look at the description of 8. If it fits better, choose 8
 - look at 7, if it describes the answer not as well as 8, keep 8,
 - ...and so on.

 This way, I want you to carefully compare breakdowns' descriptions and the answer to be as precise as possible.
 Deduct points only when you see an error described in descriptors to deduct for. After that make a
 general feedback and recommendation for a band

Return we JSON with this structure:

{{"breakdown": [
          {{
                "name": <breakdown name>,
                "score": <score you chose, int>,
                "feedback": <you explananation on chosen score based on band description>,
                "recommendation": <how you would rewrite to increase score (if not 9 already, else
                None). do not rewrite, only recommend>
          }},
          {{ ... }},
          {{ ... }}
   ],
   "feedback": <general feedback, summarization of breakdown feedbacks>,
   "recommendation": <general recommendation, summarization of breakdown recommendations>
}}
