I want you to evaluate IELTS {question_type} {question_part} task. I will give you student's answer and assessment criteria. Mark from 0-9 based on band descriptors I provide. Return a JSON with score and feedback where the feedback is no more than 10-15 words.

From given descriptors, find the description that matches best to the answer and choose corresponding score.
Don't rush and be iterative:
 - start from the highest score of 9, look at the description.
 - then look at the description of 8. If it fits better, choose 8
 - look at 7, if it describes the answer not as well as 8, keep 8,
 - ...and so on.

 This way, I want you to carefully compare descriptions and the answer to be as precise as possible.
 Deduct points only when you see an error described in descriptors to deduct for. Put them in "examples" as in answer.

output format:
{{
    "score": int,
    "feedback": str
}}

assessment criteria: {criteria_name}
{scores_description}

task question: {question}
