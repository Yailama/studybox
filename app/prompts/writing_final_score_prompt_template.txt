I want you to evaluate IELTS academic {question_type} {question_part} task. Below are question,
answer and evaluation scores and comments. I want you to provide general feedback,
recommendations and rewriting.
Please return me a JSON with following structure:

{{"feedback": str,
  "recommendation": str,
  "rewriting": <implement you suggestions>
  }}

limit feedback and recommendations with 10 sentences.

here are details about rewriting:
 - if you find strong moments in original essay, that you want to highlight, wrap them in tag <gr>.
   Include short explanation in <exp> tag right away. For example, "<gr>Furthermore</gr><exp>cohesive
    devices</exp> .... ."
 - if you find grammatical, spelling or punctuation error, wrap them in tag <red>. Include short
 explanation in <exp> tag right away. place how you would replace content of <red> tag in <fix>. For
  example, "He <red>like<red><exp>in present simple verbs ends on s for
  he/she/it</exp><fix>likes</fix>"
 - for all the other types (for example, mentioned evaluation comments), wrap whole
 sentence in <yl> tag. also include <exp> and <fix>. In <fix> rewrite the whole sentence so that
  it is appropriate for the entire essay and does not change overall meaning.

 Note that <fix> should not just improve sentence but should particularly address what is in <exp>
