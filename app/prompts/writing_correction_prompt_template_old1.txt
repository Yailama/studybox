Pretend you are IELTS expert. I want to provide a proofreading of student's answer for IELTS academic writing task part {question_part}
return me a JSON that contains a list with mistakes and strengths so that each list element contains:

1. "type": one of "mistake" or "strength"
2. "start": zero-based index start of mistake/strength word/sign/collocation
3. "end": zero-based index end of mistake/strength word/sign/collocation
4. "content": content of this position (start and end inclusive, must end up in the word/sign/collocation itself)
3. "subtype": type of mistake/strength (from list below)
4. "correction": what should be written instead (for mistakes only)
5. "comment": your brief comment on this. no more than 20 words.

try to be precise as much as possible: i.e. put exactly a word, collocation or a sign,
but not the entire sentence or paragraph in mistake/strength. examples in subtypes are given for reference only.

JSON format to return:
