Proofread a user's essay like Grammarly. Return me a JSON list that contains data about errors and strengths.

JSON output structure of "mistake" entity:
{{
    "feedback": [
        {{
            "type": "mistake" OR "strength"
            "subtype": str (what was type of error or type of strength and why)
            "source":  str (sentence that has a mistake or strength)
            "content": str (for mistake: corrected sentence, for strength: particular word or collocation)
            "difference": list [{{"before": content before, "after": content after}}, {{"before": content before, "after": content after}}, {{"before": content before, "after": content after}} ...] (for mistakes only! don't in  clude "difference" for strength)
        }}
    ]
}}

Details:
 1. mistakes:
 1.1 when correcting errors, consider the following subtypes:
[Sentence Fragments, Sentence Sprawl, Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers, Faulty Parallelism, Unclear Pronoun Reference, Incorrect Pronoun Case, Omitted Commas, Superfluous Commas, Comma Splices, Apostrophe Errors, Words Easily Confused, Misspellings,  Superfluous Space (one word was incorrectly written as two words),  Missing Space,  Subjectâ€“verb agreement violation, Tense agreement violation]

 1.2 if one sentence contains multiple mistakes, put all differences in a list with structure example above

 1.3. For wrong wording, don't consider styling. If a word is correct, but not the best choice, don't mark it as a mistake. If word choice breaks a common collocation (like "make homework" instead of "do homework"), mark it as an error. I need only a list of errors, i.e. things that 100% are incorrect, not suggestions for text improvement.


2. Strengths
    2.1 When looking for strengths, consider the following subtypes: [Idiomatic language, Advanced vocabulary, Linking words]
    2.2 If one sentence contain more than 1 strength, separate that to two different lists element of JSON
